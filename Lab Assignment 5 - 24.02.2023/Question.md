# Question

Given a sorted array A containing N integers both positive and negative.
You need to create another array containing the squares of all the elements in A and return it in non-decreasing order.
Write a Python program to implement this in O(N) time.

Example Input

```text
Input 1:
A = [-6, -3, -1, 2, 4, 5]
Input 2:
A = [-5, -4, -2, 0, 1]
```

Example Output

```text
Output 1:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
Output 2:
[0, 1, 4, 16, 25]
```
