# Question 1

Program 1 :
Given an M Ã— N matrix, which is row-wise and column-wise sorted (with all strictly increasing elements
in any row or column), write a program in Python to report all occurrences of a given element in it in
linear time.
For example,
Input:

```text
[ -4 -3 -1 3 5 ]
[ -3 -2 2 4 6 ]
[ -1 1 3 5 8 ]
[ 3 4 7 8 9 ]
```

Output:

```text
Element 3 is found at position (0, 3)
Element 3 is found at position (2, 2)
Element 3 is found at position (3, 0)
```
