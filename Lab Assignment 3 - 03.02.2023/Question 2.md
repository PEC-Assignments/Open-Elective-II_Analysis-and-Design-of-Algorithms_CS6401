# Question 2

Given a string 'S'. Write a program to find an array of all possible strings in any order that can be formed by transforming every letter individually to the lowercase or the uppercase.
Note:

1. You can print the array in any order.
2. The string 'S' only contains English alphabets and digits.

Sample Input 1:
a1b
Sample Output 1:
A1B A1b a1B a1b

Sample Input 2:
0
Sample Output 2:
